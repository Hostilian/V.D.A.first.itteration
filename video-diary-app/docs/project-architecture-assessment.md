# Project Architecture Assessment Tool

This document provides tools and checklists for evaluating the current project structure of the Video Diary App.

## Project Structure Analysis

| Directory/File Pattern | Expected Purpose | Assessment Questions |
|------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| `assets/` | Static resources | Are assets organized by type? Are they optimized for mobile? |
| `components/` | Reusable UI components | Are components properly modularized? Is there component reuse? |
| `screens/` | Screen components | Are screens focused on composition rather than implementation? |
| `navigation/` | Navigation configuration | Is navigation centralized and well-organized? |
| `services/` | API and third-party integrations | Are external services abstracted behind clean interfaces? |
| `hooks/` | Custom React hooks | Is business logic extracted into reusable hooks? |
| `utils/` | Helper functions | Are utilities pure and well-tested? |
| `state/` | State management | Is state properly organized and accessible? |
| `constants/` | App constants | Are magic numbers and strings replaced with named constants? |

## React Native & Expo Best Practices Checklist

### Project Configuration

- [ ] Uses the latest stable Expo SDK
- [ ] Properly configured app.json/app.config.js
- [ ] Appropriate babel plugins configured
- [ ] Proper handling of environment variables
- [ ] Metro configuration optimized for performance

### Component Structure

- [ ] Functional components with hooks (preferred over class components)
- [ ] Proper prop validation (PropTypes or TypeScript)
- [ ] Memoization for expensive components (React.memo)
- [ ] Components follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Styling approach is consistent (StyleSheet, styled-components, or similar)

### Navigation

- [ ] Uses React Navigation (current recommended version)
- [ ] Proper navigation structure (stack, tab, drawer) based on UX needs
- [ ] Navigation state properly managed
- [ ] Deep linking support where appropriate

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Virtualized lists for long content (FlatList, SectionList)
- [ ] Properly implemented shouldComponentUpdate or React.memo
- [ ] Optimized image loading and caching
- [ ] Minimal render blocking operations
- [ ] Proper use of useCallback and useMemo

### Native Features & Expo APIs

- [ ] Proper permission handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation when features aren't available
- [ ] Efficient use of device resources (camera, storage, etc.)
- [ ] Proper lifecycle management of hardware resources

## Separation of Concerns Evaluation Matrix

Score each area from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent):

### UI Components
- __/5: Components focus solely on presentation
- __/5: Business logic is extracted to hooks or services
- __/5: Component reusability
- __/5: Component composability
- __/5: Consistent styling approach

### Business Logic
- __/5: Logic separated from UI
- __/5: Domain-specific operations grouped together
- __/5: Reusable across multiple components
- __/5: Testable in isolation
- __/5: Properly abstracted data manipulation

### Data Management
- __/5: Clear data flow architecture
- __/5: Appropriate state management for complexity
- __/5: Data fetching separated from display logic
- __/5: Caching strategy implemented
- __/5: Error handling for data operations

### Navigation/Routing
- __/5: Centralized navigation configuration
- __/5: Screen components don't directly manipulate navigation
- __/5: Navigation state properly managed
- __/5: Deep linking supported where appropriate
- __/5: Navigation logic separate from business logic

## Modularization Assessment

### Current Module Boundaries
List the current modules/features and their boundaries:
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Module Coupling Analysis
For each module pair, rate the coupling from 1 (loose) to 5 (tight):

| Module A | Module B | Coupling Score | Notes |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------|
|          |          |               |       |
|          |          |               |       |
|          |          |               |       |

### Recommended Module Reorganization
Based on the analysis, recommend how modules should be reorganized:

1. 
2. 
3. 

## Action Plan

Based on this assessment, prioritize the following actions to improve the project architecture:

### High Priority (Address Immediately)
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Medium Priority (Address in Next Few Sprints)
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Low Priority (Address When Convenient)
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Recommended Tools & Libraries

| Category | Recommended Tool | Purpose | Implementation Difficulty |
|----------|------------------|---------|--------------------------|
| Linting | ESLint with React Native config | Code quality | Low |
| State Management | Redux Toolkit or Context API | App state | Medium |
| Navigation | React Navigation v6+ | Screen navigation | Medium |
| Styling | Styled Components or StyleSheet | Component styling | Low |
| Testing | Jest + React Testing Library | Unit/component tests | Medium |
| Type Checking | TypeScript | Type safety | Medium-High |
